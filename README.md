## Description
Fan project, designed for personal use. Only after working on the program for dozens of hours did I realize an impressively polished fan-web-port for onw already exists. I don't plan to surpass it though I don't plan to bail out either, instead treating this as practice.

I'll write a small documentation once I feel more confident in the code's naming and structure.
